Code and schemes for the thesis can be seperated into those I used in private on my home PC, which is in the matlab 2023a folder, and the files used on the lab PC, which is in the matlab 2020b folder.

Any files not in either of these folders are just random duplicates and can be ignored. I just can't be bothered to delete them yet since I don't know a fast way to do it on Github.
